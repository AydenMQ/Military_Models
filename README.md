# Model Suite

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook models developed as part of a scientific manuscript. Each model is designed to predict a simulated military assessment outcome using either a ridge regression or a support vector regression. Each notebook follows a logical order and structure, providing reproducible and transparent data analysis for researchers and practitioners. This suite supports applications in performance modelling, prediction, and cross-validation for various populations.
